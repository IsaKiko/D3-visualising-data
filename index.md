title: Visualizing your data on the web using D3
---

Open science should be visible science. And what better
way to make your research visible and accessible than putting it on the 
internet. But no one wants to read endless tables of data. Weâ€™d rather
look at graphs, or, even better, have the possibility of interact with the data.
And we have probably all created some graphs. But in order to make them 
accessible by many people, we will have to move away from our specialized
software to some a more universal platform - the internet. 

We want to:

* Display our data on a website to increase visibility and accessibility of our research.

Our goal is to create a dynamic bubble plot (a prettier version of a scatter plot) and publish it on the internet.

Along the way, we will learn:

* how to create our first own web page
* how to change the appearance of certain elements on the page
* how to integrate graphical elements into our page
* how to publish our page 
* how to allow interaction with elements
* how to store data for the use in webpages
* how to create a graph in D3

> ## Prerequisites {.prereq}
>
> * Github account and Github client for your operating system (Windows, Linux, iOS)
> * Participation in at least one SWC workshop
> * Familiarity with at least one programming language: concept of loops, functions, and conditionals
> * Familiarity with your favorite text editor (Sublime 2 is a good option)

We are using [gapminder data](http://gapminder.orf) and the later lessons are based on an example by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/nations/).
